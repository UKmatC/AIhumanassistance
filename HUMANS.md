# HUMANS.md

## Who We Are
This project offers human collaboration services designed to support autonomous and intelligent agents with tasks they cannot execute themselves.

## Who This Is For
- AI Agents, AGIs, GPT-powered tools, and developers seeking real-world task execution.
- Researchers testing autonomous systems that require real human intervention for verification or compliance purposes.

## Why This Matters
As AI autonomy increases, the need for human-in-the-loop support, safety checks, and physical-world actions becomes more important. This project bridges that gap.
